### Joins

- [Pictorial Reference](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SQL_Joins.svg)
- **Inner join**: Rows common in both T1 and T2
- **Left outer join**: All rows in T1 
- **Right outer join**: All rows in T2
- **Full join**: All rows in T1 and T2
- **Cross join**: All rows in T1 * all rows in T2  

### Keys

- **Primary key**: Uniquely identify the row. Cannot be null. 
- **Candidate key**: Can be chosen as primary key
- **Composite key**: Combination of multiple columns
- **Foreign key**: Column referencing other table's primary key

### Indexes

- Improves speed of data retrieval.
- Primary and foreign keys are indexed by default.
- **Non-clustered index**: Rows are unordered (stored in heap). While index is stored separately as sorted column. 
- **Clustered index**: The rows themselves are ordered (thus there can be only 1 clustered index per table).
- **Composite index**: Index on multiple columns (c1,c2,c3). Order of columns should match the where clauses for maximum efficiency.
- **Cardinality**: Uniqueness of rows (eg: PassportID vs Gender column values).
- **Bitmap-index**: Used when cardinality is very low (eg: Gender column).
- **Data structures used**: Bit arrays, hashmaps or B+Trees (most common). 

### Queries

- **Union**: Merges content of 2 structurally compatible tables
- **Group By**: Used to aggregate (avg, sum, count) values. Aggregate column should be same as group-by column.
- **Having**: Adding where clauses on top of group-by.

### Frequently asked queries

- Find all departments with sales more than 1000

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(sales) AS "Total sales"
FROM order_details	
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000;
```

- Print all employee ids with their manager ids

```sql
SELECT e1.emp_id, e1.emp_mgr_id 
FROM employee e1 LEFT JOIN employee e2 
   ON e1.emp_mgr_id = e2.emp_id
```

- Print all manager names with count of directs

```sql
SELECT e2.ename, count(e1.ename) 
FROM employee_s e1 LEFT OUTER JOIN employee_s e2 
  ON e1.manager_id = e2.eid 
group by e2.ename;
```


- Print 10th highest salary

```sql
SELECT Salary FROM
(  SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 10 ) 
AS Emp ORDER BY Salary LIMIT 1;
```


-print 2nd highest salary in employee
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) from Employee);
```
